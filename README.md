Before contributing check: 
### :red_circle: Pull Request Guidelines

- The master branch is basically just a snapshot of the latest stable release. All development should be done in dedicated branches, that will be merged into test branch.

- Each commit should succeed respect Clean Code Criterias.

- Check the projects tab and make sure you fixed/coded one of the given tasks. 

- Each pull request should succeed Tests that will be included.

- **Do not submit PRs against the master branch.**

- It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - even a small "typo" fix is acceptable.

- If adding new feature:
  - Provide convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally you should open a suggestion issue first and have it greenlighted before working on it.

- If fixing a bug or more globally resolving an issue:
  - Add (fix: #xxxx[,#xxx]) (#xxxx is the issue id) in your PR title for a better release log, e.g. fix: update entities encoding/decoding (fix #3899).
  - Provide detailed description of the bug in the PR.

- Again, **Do not submit PRs against the master branch.**
